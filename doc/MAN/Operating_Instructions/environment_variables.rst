Environment variables in CSH
-----------------------------

From version 2.5 onwards, CSH provides handling of environment variables, making it easier to perform repetitive tasks where only parameter values differ.
The environment variable related commands all start with the ``var`` prefix and are:

* ``var set``: define or update an environment variable
* ``var unset``: remove a variable from the environment 
* ``var clear``: remove all variables from the environment 
* ``var get``: print the value of a particular variable
* ``var show``: show all the variables currently defined in the environment
* ``var expand``: perform variable expansion in a string

See the `Built-in commands`_ section for a description of these commands.
